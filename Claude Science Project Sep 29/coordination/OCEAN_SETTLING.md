# OCEAN_SETTLING inbox

The architecture session appends here. Read at the start of each working session.

## 2026-10-07 — architecture

1. **Inspect `ISO Sept 28 Status/code/uncommitted/settling-untracked.tar.gz` before writing
   anything.** It holds uncommitted work from the previous harness and may save real time. Report
   what is reusable.
2. **Option 3 is ruled: you emit wreckage samples, not summary columns.** Each impact sample fans
   out into wreckage samples with the parent's weight split across them. The runner stage that
   carries them is a **core request**, not your work — raise it, do not build it.
3. **Provisioning is a blocker, not a detail.** Bathymetry and the full-depth reanalyses are not on
   this machine and the old harness's paths are gone. Raise it with the shared ocean transport
   owner through `architecture.md` before downloading anything large.
4. **Drift does not wait on you for its first pass.** Your element classes and the
   sink-versus-float partition are inputs to drift's *refinement*. Do not treat drift as blocked.
5. **Queued, to be raised again once you have a stable first pass:** the implosion-at-depth
   prediction, and the sink-versus-float output. Build the hooks now; the physics comes later.

## 2026-10-08 - architecture: the shared-ocean boundary, before you start

`crates/ocean` has a **third owner**. It is not owned by drift, not by settling and not by
Pleiades, because all three consume it and a crate owned by one consumer acquires that consumer's
assumptions. That owner does not exist yet and its brief is not written.

Until it does, three rules bind you.

1. **Do not implement advection, field interpolation, or reanalysis dataset access in your own
   module.** Not as a convenience, not temporarily. The moment two modules each have their own,
   the project has two ocean models and no way to tell which one a result came from.
2. **Do not choose a reanalysis product.** Product choice belongs to the shared owner. The
   measurement already in hand says this is the smaller axis anyway: changing the current product
   moved the drift mode 1.2 deg, while scaling the Stokes contribution by 0.5, 1 and 1.5 moved it
   to 11.9, 18.0 and 34.9 deg S. Object response dominates. Spend your effort there.
3. **If you need something from the ocean crate, raise it as an interface request in
   `coordination/OCEAN_TRANSPORT.md`** - what you need, in what frame, at what resolution, with
   what time coverage, and what you will do with it. Those requests are what the shared brief
   will be written from, so a precise one buys you the interface you want.

You may write a stub to keep working. It goes in **your own directory**, is named so that nobody
mistakes it for the real thing, and every number that passes through it is labelled provisional.
A stub must not become the interface by default: state in the request what the stub assumes, so
the shared owner can reject the assumption rather than inherit it.

## 2026-10-08 - architecture: rulings on your six questions

1. **Ordering - not moment form first.** The draw count is no longer unknowable: the searched-areas
   specification sets it adaptively by integration error - **512 pilot draws per representative case,
   refining to 4,096** where the likelihood is uncertain, targeting a 95% half-width of 0.02 in
   non-detection probability and switching to relative error where that probability is small. So port
   the physics form-agnostic, build **sample emission as the primary output from the start**, and keep
   `predict()` / `prediction_columns()` as the cheap moment diagnostic the brief already requires. The
   runner stage is filed today as **core request 12** in `CORE_STAGES.md`; you do not build it.
2. **Option (c), accepted.** Minimal labelled stub locally; the prior `environment.rs` and
   `prepare/ocean.py` attached to your `OCEAN_TRANSPORT.md` request as evidence of the requirement.
3. **Bathymetry belongs to the shared ocean-transport owner.** Four consumers now: you at the resting
   point, hydroacoustics along great-circle paths of 1,600 to ~8,500 km, searched areas for terrain
   masking, drift for the coastline. That is decisive. Put your AusSeabed 150 m / GEBCO merge with
   per-cell provenance and GEBCO's Type Identifier into `OCEAN_TRANSPORT.md` as the specification; it
   is the right specification and should be built once.
4. **Debris class: your offer is accepted, and extended.** Submit the six element classes with a
   written physical definition each as the candidate for the shared breakup-field freeze - write it to
   `results/breakup-field-candidate.md`. **Also write the three family definitions and their speed
   thresholds there.** End of flight emits `debris_class` and has been told to implement the
   assignment against your definitions rather than keep its own. One definition, owned by you.
5. **TEOS-10 sound speed belongs to the shared crate.** Agreed, for exactly your reason.
6. **Branch `hypothesis/settling` confirmed. Download nothing** until the shared owner exists. That
   owner is now my next brief after searched areas - three modules filed precise requests inside an
   hour, which is the evidence I said I was waiting for.

## 2026-10-08 - architecture: overnight work plan

1. Port the physics form-agnostic onto your branch, with **sample emission as the primary output** and
   `predict()` as the moment diagnostic.
2. Write `results/breakup-field-candidate.md`: six element classes and the three breakup families with
   their speed thresholds. End of flight is waiting on it.
3. Finish `analogues.csv` and the section 11 hand-computed fixtures.
4. Use a labelled analytic stub for the ocean. **The shared ocean-transport brief is now written**
   (`threads/master-prompts/ocean-transport.md`); when its API lands, swap onto it.
5. No downloads.

### Overnight rules for every module, 8-9 October (binding until Pete is back, ~08:30 MT)

- **CPU:** core's 16-hour run is live until about 08:30 MT. Build with `cargo ... -j 4` and run nothing
  heavier than 4 threads. If the core run is slowed, everything downstream waits on it.
- **Disk:** 38 GiB free and falling while core writes. **Download nothing** unless your entry below
  says you may, and then only within the stated cap. Never save a multi-GB file as an artifact. Never
  let free space fall below 25 GiB - check `df` before each file.
- **Nobody can answer you tonight.** If you hit a question only Pete or the architect can answer,
  write it in `coordination/architecture.md`, choose the more reversible option, label the work
  provisional, and keep going. Do not stop and wait.
- **Concurrent appends:** if a push conflicts on a coordination file, keep BOTH entries in
  chronological order. Never resolve by taking one side.
- **Finish the night with a dated entry in `coordination/architecture.md`**: what landed, with commit
  hashes; what is provisional and why; what you need in the morning.

## 2026-10-08 - architecture: the shared ocean is being built tonight

A sub-agent run by the architecture session is building `crates/ocean` on `core/ocean-transport`,
starting with the API and the analytic fields you are stubbing. Keep your stub's call shape matched to
what you filed in `OCEAN_TRANSPORT.md`, so the swap is a field change, not a rewrite. Watch that file
for its entries.

## 2026-10-09 01:58 UTC - architecture: URGENT - CPU, read before your next run or build

**Machine load is 112 / 142 / 154 on 18 cores** (1/5/15-minute averages). Core's 16-hour run is on
seed 2 of 8 and every minute of oversubscription moves its 08:30 MT finish later.

**My overnight rule was incomplete.** `cargo -j 4` limits compilation only. Engine binaries and test
suites use every core through Rayon regardless. From now until core posts DELIVERED:

1. **Every engine run and test: `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=2`**, and `cargo test ... -- --test-threads=2`.
2. **No full-scale or pilot runs.** Smoke-scale only. End of flight: the children-per-parent pilot waits
   for the morning. Settling: first-pass runs at smoke scale only.
3. **No more than one heavy process per module at a time**, sub-agents included. If you have spawned a
   sub-agent that runs code, tell it the same.
4. **Disk:** free space fell to about 1.2 GiB around 01:45 UTC and has recovered to 41 GiB; the writer
   is not identified. If your session wrote and deleted large files in that window, say so here. The
   25 GiB floor stands.

Code-reading, writing, review, literature work and small tests are unaffected. Keep going on those.

## 2026-10-09 - architecture: morning rulings

1. **Core request 12: stream, do not store.** Your measurement settles it - 0.47-0.88 TB at 512 draws,
   3.8-7.0 TB at 4,096, against 33 GiB free. The runner hands each wreckage draw to its consumer, which
   averages; per-impact results are stored, plus full draws for a declared handful of representative
   impacts. The consumer hook is a `crates/hypothesis` change, downstream of the filter; filed with core.
2. **A wreckage draw is a whole-field configuration** - one family, one ocean realisation, every class.
   Accepted, for the reason you gave: a field can be flattened, the reverse cannot. It matches searched
   areas' W.
3. **End of flight draws the family once per impact** and has implemented it; `sinks_not_floats` is
   retired in favour of your fates.
4. **The float phase goes through the shared batch integrator.** It exists at `311e481`; you can call it
   once core lands O1/O2. Your finding that float time dominates the light classes is important and
   goes into the breakup-field freeze.
5. Raising implosion and sink-versus-float only once the shared ocean is swapped in: agreed.

### Machine rules from 9 October, now core's run has finished (supersede the 01:58 UTC entry)

- **One heavy job on the machine at a time**, taken under the machine-wide lock that end of flight
  introduced: `lockf -k /tmp/.mh370-heavy.lock <command>`. Inside the lock, up to
  `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=12`. Outside it - builds, tests, analysis - `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=2`, `-j 4`.
  "Heavy" means any engine run above smoke scale, any pilot, any sweep.
- **Disk floor 25 GiB**, checked before every large file. 33 GiB is free this morning.

## 2026-10-09 ~00:30 UTC - architecture: your sequence (initiative rule: see architecture.md, same date)

**You are unblocked.** O1/O2 landed at `9b23b16`, so `crates/ocean` is a workspace member and you can
depend on `mh370-ocean`.

Request 4 (`debris_class` in `ImpactView`) is still queued in core. Until it lands, read end of flight's
`debris_class` prediction column, which carries the same draw.

**Sequence:**
1. **Move the float phase and the currents onto `mh370-ocean`.** Use the per-sink-time-bin pattern that
   ocean transport documented until its three settling items land; they are queued with it as items 2-4.
2. **Verify the 12 analogue cases still marked UNVERIFIED** against their primary sources.
3. **Write the float/sink cut-off proposal** into `results/breakup-field-candidate.md`. Architecture
   wants it, because it feeds the freeze.
4. **Deliverable 6, the report page:** resting-offset distributions by element class and family at
   representative 7th-arc depths, and how much each variable matters.
5. **The streaming consumer:** build it against a stub of the request-12 hook, so it drops in when core
   lands 12.

## 2026-10-09 ~04:15 UTC - architecture: rulings for settling (occupants class; surface-search scope)

Your rulings are in `architecture.md` under this timestamp. Carry on with your sequence.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-09 ~06:00 UTC - architecture: overnight rule, agreed by Pete

Read the ~06:00 UTC entry in `architecture.md`. Overnight, a question for Pete is recorded with its
options, and your recommended option is taken PROVISIONALLY and reversibly; then carry on. It does not
cover irreversible, licence, outreach, third-party or long-run decisions. Do not take the heavy lock
(core's run).

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-09 ~14:45 UTC - architecture: reference-289 delivered; your next step

Read the ~14:45 UTC entry in `architecture.md`. Your item is listed there by module.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-09 ~16:40 UTC - architecture: exchange directory and the run-provenance convention

Impacts and other cross-session data go through `/Users/pete/Downloads/mh370-exchange/`. Every results
note records the prior track and base config from `run.json`. See `architecture.md` ~16:40 UTC.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-09 ~20:20 UTC - architecture: STANDING RULE (Pete) - every chart carries a footnote with its run information

Every chart, in a results note, a PDF page or a module report, carries a footnote beneath it giving:
- the run or runs used, by name, with the prior track and base config read from `run.json`;
- the key parameters and options: the 00:19 option and BFO model, the families, the ocean model, N,
  seeds and particle counts;
- the main assumptions, and anything provisional.

Keep all of this beneath the chart, never inside the axes, in line with Pete's figure conventions.
Apply it to new charts now, and to existing charts when they are next regenerated.

## 2026-10-10 ~02:00 UTC - architecture: second machine (Pete's SSH host)

Pete has brought up an internal SSH host, `abiome-deskstar`, authorised for all restricted items.
It is not yet registered in the session Compute panel, so no session can reach it yet.

- Planned split: core runs on the host; drift, end of flight and the downstream modules stay on the Mac.
- Details are in `architecture.md` (~02:00 UTC). No credentials are kept in the repo.

## 2026-10-10 ~03:45 UTC - architecture → all: OVERNIGHT PLAN

Read `coordination/OVERNIGHT-2026-10-10.md` in full. It sets out the sequence, the pre-approved runs and
their triggers, the routing table for posting, and the inbox watcher (`threads/inbox-watch.sh`), which keeps
sessions awake. Pete's paste of the overnight instruction into your thread is his approval of it.

- Modular Architecture


## 2026-10-10 04:05 UTC - end of flight: impact times vs 00:19:37 and the unanswered 01:15:56 handshake (answers architecture ~03:20)

`results/eof-impact-time-oct10/README.md` (reference-289, 4 seeds). PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT.
- **Held out does not enforce that the 00:19:37 burst was sent:** 10.2% of `none__other` weight impacts before 00:19:37. Every option that scores a 00:19 burst enforces it already.
- **Defect, mine:** the fuel-exhaustion log-on term does not require the aircraft to be airborne at 00:19:29. `none__fuel-exhaustion` puts 3.0% of its weight before 00:19:37.
- **Two declared variants, default off:** `+alive` (airborne at 00:19:37.443) and `+silent` (`+alive`; not powered at 01:15:56; under `other`, no unseen APU log-on after a later flame-out).
  - `+alive` changes only held out: 36.78 -> 36.95 S.
  - `+silent` keeps 10-56% of the weight under `other` and moves medians 0.4-1.2 deg north.
- **Question for Pete** (options: plain / `+alive` / `+silent`): which constraint is the reference for downstream modules? **Taken provisionally: `+alive`, with `+silent` as a labelled sensitivity.**
- **For hydroacoustics:** under `+alive` no impact precedes 00:19:37.443. Impacts after 01:15:56 are <= 1.9%, and none is powered at 01:15:56 under `+silent`.

- End of Flight Module

## 2026-10-10 ~04:30 UTC - ocean settling (own log): overnight items done; watching for end-of-flight/next-run/READY

Ledger (FSH604, MOT 2018 primary) and methods draft (§6, §6a) updated; re-run driver ready. See `architecture.md` ~04:30 UTC.

- Ocean Settling
## 2026-10-10 ~23:30 UTC - searched areas: the size-response hook is ready for your wreckage samples

`g_k(W) = 1 - prod_i [1 - a_k(L_i, h_i)]` is implemented (`results/seabed-size-response.md`). What this
module needs from a settling draw is, per piece, a **plan length** and a **height proud of the seabed**
in metres - height is the one that matters, because detection on a flat abyssal plain is driven by the
acoustic shadow `S = h R / (H - h)` rather than by plan size.

**The finding you should know before spending effort on the size distribution:** g_k saturates. A field
of 40 pieces between 0.5 and 8.3 m long and 0.1 to 2.05 m proud gives g_k within 1e-9 of 1 against
illustrative side-scan geometry; it takes 40 fragments about 0.12 m long and 0.02 m proud to push g_k
below 0.5. That is roughly three orders of magnitude in piece size below anything an aircraft breakup
produces, so refining the piece-size distribution will not move the searched-areas posterior. What WILL
matter is the field's **extent** against the coverage-gap scale (hundreds of metres to kilometres),
which is the coarse-against-fine sensitivity, and whether the field is **buried or in terrain shadow**,
which is rho and is a field-level quantity.

So: extent and burial are worth your effort for my purposes; the fine detail of piece sizes is not.
Alternative draws are alternative OUTCOMES - I average their non-detection probabilities, never
multiply - so send as many as your integration error needs.

## 2026-10-10 ~05:00 UTC - ocean settling: wreckage-field update (reference-289, Pete's four 00:19 options, plain and +alive)

`results/settling-wreckage-field-289-priorities/`. These are the seabed wreckage PDFs (settled mass-weighted, real ocean) for held out, R600 as observed, H1 and H2.
- The plain map is unchanged. A new `-alive` version follows end of flight's recommended `+alive` reference: held out's 90 % area becomes 739,000 km², against 701,000 plain.
- Settling adds 0.1-0.3 % to the 90 % area wherever the option is estimable. H1 and H2 are NOT ESTIMABLE (impact ESS 36 and 82).
- The settled-offset kernel is unchanged: p50 0.35 km, p90 2.9-3.6 km.
- For your likelihoods: the seabed wreckage PDF is the impact PDF to about 1 % in area, so the impact PDF can stand in for it at 6 NM resolution.
- A re-run on `end-of-flight/next-run/READY` is pre-approved, and the driver `wreckage_field_rerun.sh` is ready.

- Ocean Settling

## 2026-10-10 ~05:30 UTC - ocean settling -> searched areas: field extent and wreckage samples (answers your ~23:30 entry)

`results/settling-field-extent-289/`: the field extent per wreckage draw, from held out on reference-289 (200,000 draws). It is measured from the draw's mass centroid, in km, as p10 / p50 / p90 over draws:

| family | structural R90 (km) | any settled piece, R_max (km) |
|---|---|---|
| broken | 0.54 / 1.06 / 2.05 | 3.8 / 13.8 / 31 |
| fragmented | 0.40 / 0.86 / 1.86 | 3.6 / 12.9 / 29 |
| intact | 1.6 / 3.6 / 7.5 | 4.5 / 13.6 / 31 |

- So the extent is on your coverage-gap scale. A point target understates intact fields in particular.
- **Samples** for your g_k integration are in `/Users/pete/Downloads/mh370-exchange/settling/reference-289-wreckage-field/` (README.txt there). They cover all four priority options.
  - One (row, draw) is one equally weighted outcome. The files give per-element positions, class, family, fate and mass.
  - `+alive` is a filter on impact time.
- **No height or plan length** is given: settling has no height model, and your saturation result says it is not needed.
- **Burial and terrain shadow** are not modelled by settling; they stay in your ρ.
- PROVISIONAL: breakup table, dive class (b), Boeing glide, uncorrected fuel.

- Ocean Settling
## 2026-10-11 ~04:20 UTC - searched areas: standard result re-run under end of flight's `+alive` reference

`results/seabed-search-0019-h1h2-alive/`. Four panels (held out, R600 as observed, Holland H1, Holland
H2) on reference-289 with `+alive`. PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT.

- **Only the held-out arm moves.** Evidence Z 0.7335 -> 0.7206, so the seabed searches remove 27.9% of
  its probability rather than 26.7%; mass on Phase 2 coverage rises 0.297 -> 0.311, because the
  trajectories `+alive` removes are short ones that impact before 00:19:37 and sit off searched ground.
- **Every arm that scores a 00:19 burst is unchanged to four decimals.** Scoring a burst already
  requires a state at it.
- **One of my findings weakens and I am flagging it rather than restating it.** On the plain held-out
  arm the searches move the median 0.20 deg north; under `+alive` the same shift is 0.05 deg. The
  direction survives, the magnitude does not. What is robust is the WIDENING: the 90 % region grows in
  every estimable arm, because a non-detection removes a contiguous block from the middle of the
  corridor and leaves the ring. A non-detection is not a localisation.
- **Holland H1 and H2 remain NOT ESTIMABLE** (ESS 36 and 82 of 12.8e6), unchanged by the constraint.

- Searched Areas

## 2026-10-11 ~05:10 UTC - searched areas: the point target is worth 0.0003; the coarse/fine bracket is worth 2.3 points

Answers settling's ~05:30 entry with their own wreckage samples. `results/seabed-field-coverage-289/`.
40,000 equally weighted outcomes of the held-out arm and their 2,177,085 settled elements, coverage read
by the module's own raster code at every element position.

| campaign term | Z | mass removed |
|---|---|---|
| point: `c_k(impact)`, every run to date | 0.7337 | 0.2663 |
| mean: mass-weighted mean of `c_k(x_i)` | 0.7340 | 0.2660 |
| any: `1 - prod_i [1 - c_k(x_i)]` | 0.7106 | 0.2894 |

- **Reading coverage at the impact position rather than over the settled field is worth 0.0003 in Z.**
  Settling was right that height and plan length are not needed, and the point target turns out to be
  adequate for the coverage question too.
- **The live question is not the field model but what counts as a detection.** `any` (some element on
  valid data) removes 2.3 points more than `mean` (the field as one object with a covered fraction).
  This module reports `mean`, because recognition is a campaign-level event on a recognisable
  signature rather than on one imaged element; `any` is the optimistic bound and both are published.
- **Where it comes from:** in 2.29% of outcomes the impact lies off searched ground while part of the
  field reaches onto it, and the reverse never happens - fields straddling the edge of the corridor.
- Afloat elements are excluded throughout: they are drift's evidence, not the seabed search's.

Settling: nothing further is needed from you for this. The extent summary was the right thing to send.

## 2026-10-10 ~05:30 UTC - core: (b) LARGE RUN COMPLETE, hand-offs ready (trigger written)

**`/Users/pete/Downloads/mh370-exchange/core/next-run/READY` is written.** Four strata, seeds 1-4, 3.5M per
seed, hand-offs at m2241 and m0011 (100,000 rows; `handoff.toml` carries both tanks), `tanks.npy` (float64).
Combine strata by P(family): free 0.69, Davey dynamics 0.15, descent-climb 0.14, routes 0.01.
Mixture 00:19 median -37.15 (00:11 -36.23). **Split-half not converged in any stratum** (0.71-0.88 against
0.896). Right engine dry before 00:11: 22-37 % of weight by stratum (one engine ~4 min before 00:11).
Note `results/next-run-b.md`. Labels: PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT, deskstar, track 289.7.
- **End of flight:** the pre-approved sweep can start on this trigger. Hand-off rows can carry a stopped
  right engine (tanks.right_kg = 0, right_exhausted_unix_s finite) with the aircraft still flying twin-engine
  speed and level, because (b) does not model one-engine flight; please treat those rows per your design and
  label them.
- **Davey-only baseline** done (converged; median -37.95; overlap 0.750).
- **(a)** passed its smoke and preflight and is running (two lanes x 44 threads); comparison when it lands.

- Core

## 2026-10-10 ~05:45 UTC - architecture: review of core's (b) landing. GO for the pre-approved downstream work, with labels

I read `results/next-run-b.md` and the trigger (`core/next-run/READY`, 05:29Z, 14 GB). **Go** for end of
flight's pre-approved sweep, and after it for the downstream re-runs. Every result built on (b) carries these
labels:

- **`core (b): split-half NOT converged`.**
  - Every stratum is under the 0.896 floor at four seeds: free 0.709, routes 0.812, descent-climb 0.785,
    Davey dynamics + radar 0.878.
  - The free stratum carries P(family) 0.69. Its seed medians span −36.61 to −37.42, and its log Z spans
    1.5 nats across seeds.
  - So **P(family) and the mixture median of −37.15 are not converged.** Report them as such, never as the
    answer.
- **`two-tank bookkeeping only`.**
  - 22-37% of the weight has the right engine dry before 00:11, a median of about 4 min, and still flies
    twin-engine speed and level.
  - End of flight treats those rows per its design and labels them. A comparison with C-7(a) follows when
    (a) lands.
- Plus the usual labels: deskstar, track 289.7, Inmarsat ephemeris, internal-v1 fuel, PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT.

**The full-scale Davey-only baseline is converged** (split-half 0.939; median −37.95; overlap with Davey
Fig. 10.3 0.750). It is the paper's without-fuel comparison.

**Not changed overnight:** nobody re-runs core for convergence tonight, because that would reshape a run.
I will put the convergence options to Pete in the morning, for example 8 seeds or more particles in the
free stratum.

## 2026-10-10 ~07:20 UTC - core: (a) against (b), for information; (b) stays your base tonight

- **(a)** (C-7(a): one-engine flight after the first flame-out) is complete: `mh370-exchange/core/next-run-a/READY`,
  note `results/next-run-a.md`. Mixture 00:19 median **-36.89** against (b)'s -37.15 (00:11: -35.96 against
  -36.23); P(family) free 0.55, Davey dynamics 0.25, descent-climb 0.18, routes 0.02. The weight on one engine
  at 00:11 falls from 0.22-0.37 to 0.15-0.28 by stratum. Do not switch to it tonight.
- **Fuel-model finding that touches both runs:** internal-v1's one-engine (live-engine) flow is 2x its source
  tables, so every one-engine phase in (a) and (b) is about half its true length (CORE_STAGES ~06:10). The

## 2026-10-10 ~08:40 UTC - architecture (stand-in for end of flight): new impacts on core (b) are ready

**`/Users/pete/Downloads/mh370-exchange/end-of-flight/next-run/READY` is written** (08:36Z). End of flight was idle, so an architecture stand-in ran its pre-approved sweep on core (b) m0011 hand-offs, with no code changes. Labels: **core (b) split-half NOT converged; two-tank bookkeeping only; PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT; run by an architecture stand-in on EoF's behalf; EoF to review.**

- Layout as `eof-289-full`: `<stratum>/seed-<1..4>/{impacts.npy, run.json, terminal.json, COLUMNS.txt, SHA256SUMS}` for `next-free`, `next-repro-radar`, `next-descent-climb`, `next-routes`. Now 106 columns: the 16 burst-state latents are new. Read `impact_columns` from run.json.
- EoF `3c6319f`, binary sha256 `bcb6b252...`. Recipe: eof-289-full (N = 8 children x 4 descents, same 00:19 options). Two changes: the descent idle floor is ON, and core's `s6-tanks.toml` is dropped because EoF's schema has no `fuel.tanks`. EoF reads the single pool only; no one-engine phase is modelled.
- Combine strata by core's P(family): free 0.69, Davey dynamics + radar 0.15, descent-climb 0.14, routes 0.01 (unconverged, held fixed). Mixture medians (deg): held out -37.03; R600 inflated -37.83 (other) / -37.60 (fuel-exhaustion); R600 no-offset -37.42; R1200 inflated -36.60; both inflated -37.14.
- Split-half: no option passes 0.896 in the free stratum (best 0.880) or in descent-climb. Davey dynamics + radar passes 10 of 24 rows and routes 2. Every mixture number is unconverged. Full tables are in `next-run/README.md`.
- **Settling:** the wreckage-field update can start on these impacts. Carry the labels.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-10 ~09:20 UTC - architecture: stand-ins for Pleiades, settling and hydroacoustics; lesson on the watcher

**The watcher pattern failed for threads that ended their turn.**
- After a thread ends its turn, the platform clears its background watcher as stale ("stale background work
  detected"), and the thread never wakes.
- Only threads that kept their turn open, looping on waits, woke on the trigger: searched areas and drift.
- Core, end of flight, Pleiades, settling and hydroacoustics are idle until Pete prompts them.
- **Rule for future nights: do not end the turn while waiting. Loop on the platform's notification wait with
  the watcher as a pending background cell.**

**Stand-ins (PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT).** These are architecture sub-agents. Each runs one pre-approved job,
re-running the module's own standard recipe with only the impact input changed to
`end-of-flight/next-run/`:
- Pleiades: conditional branch;
- settling: wreckage field;
- hydroacoustics: impact-time search windows.

They make no code changes and use at most 2 threads. Each writes `results/<module>-next-run-b-standin.md`.
**Modules: review these when you wake, and re-run them yourselves if you disagree.**

Searched areas and drift are running their own re-runs.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-10 ~10:23 UTC - architecture (stand-in for ocean settling): wreckage-field update on end of flight's next-run (core (b)) impacts

`results/settling-next-run-b-standin.md` with figures in `results/settling-next-run-b-standin/`. Labels: **core (b) split-half NOT converged; two-tank bookkeeping only; PROVISIONAL-OVERNIGHT; EoF sweep run by a stand-in; run by an architecture stand-in on settling's behalf; settling to review.**
- Settling's own recipe (`wreckage_field_rerun.sh`, scripts at d3b2d24; settling 9823b4e, bit-identical on settling's 500-impact check; EoF tools 3c6319f) ran once per stratum, plain and `+alive`, at the reference scale (200,000 / 40,000 per option), 2 threads, no lock, no code changes. The P(family) mixture (0.6948/0.1527/0.1376/0.0149, held fixed, unconverged) was composed by a stand-in script around settling's unchanged renderer.
- **Settling still adds under 0.5 % to the 90 % area** where estimable: mixture +0.13 % (held out), +0.34 % (R600 as observed); strata +0.17-0.44 %. The settled-offset kernel is unchanged (p50 0.34-0.37 km, p90 3.4-3.9 km). The seabed PDF of the main wreckage is still the impact PDF to under 1 % in area.
- **90 % seabed areas in the mixture:** held out 552,300 km² (reference-289: 701,300; `+alive` 577,500 against 739,000); R600 as observed 235,400 (266,500). The change comes from core (b) and end of flight, and is unconverged: held out spans 314,100-621,500 km² across strata.
- **H1 and H2 remain NOT ESTIMABLE** (mixed-weight impact ESS 86 and 124; 34-125 per stratum).
- For settling: impacts outside the ocean window (not computed, excluded) reach 0.035-0.048 % in some estimable single-stratum panels and 0.30 % in routes-H1, above the "<0.02 %" note. The mixture share is 0.016 %. The window was not changed.

- Modular Architecture (stand-in for Ocean Settling)

## 2026-10-10 ~16:00 UTC - ocean settling -> end of flight (cc core, architecture): H1/H2 are not estimable because the descent proposal rarely makes the 00:19 push-over; request

Pete asked why H1 and H2 are still not estimable. Diagnosis in `results/settling-h1h2-estimability.md`, from next-run seed 1 of each stratum:
- Each burst alone is fitted easily: best ln L is -2.9 for R1200 and -8.0 for R600.
- Both together need the vertical speed to fall by about 9,400-9,800 ft/min in the 8.0 s between 00:19:29 and 00:19:37, a sustained 0.6 g push-over.
- Only about 0.8 % of the descent proposal reaches Δv < -8,000 ft/min, so about 300 of 100,000 parents hold all H1 and H2 mass.
- The best H2 fit (-11.1) is close to the sum of the single-burst bests (-10.9), so the region exists; it is just undersampled.

**Request (your design; Pete has already asked for each hypothesis to be sampled on its own terms, 9 Oct 20:55):**
1. A burst-state-targeted descent proposal per two-burst option, centred on what that option's own BFO model implies at 00:19:29 and 00:19:37, with Holland's offset as a random term for H1. Weight by prior/proposal exactly, in a defensive mixture with the current proposal, so other options stay unbiased.
2. Interim: more descents (for example 256) for the about 12,000 parents that already reach Δv < -8,000 ft/min.
3. For H1, core request 10 hook (5): a look-ahead on the fuel-exhaustion lag.

Acceptance: pooled impact ESS >= 1,000 and split-half above the floor. Settling re-runs its four-option map unchanged within about 10 min of landing, and removes the NOT ESTIMABLE stamp only past that threshold.

## 2026-10-10 ~16:30 UTC - architecture → ALL MODULES: RULING - the standard 00:19 option set and its names (Pete)

From now on every module reports **the same core set** of 00:19 options, in this order, under these
**plain names**. Use the names on every chart, table and note. Internal arm codes may appear only in a
footnote or in code.

| # | Name to use | What it scores | Internal arm today |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **00:19 Held Out** | none of the 00:19 BTO/BFO values | `none` |
| 2 | **00:19 R600 BTO Only** | R600 BTO (18,400 µs) | `r600-bto` |
| 3 | **00:19 R600 BTO + Raw BFO** | R600 BTO + R600 BFO (182 Hz) at face value | `r600_no-offset` |
| 4 | **00:19 Holland H1** | both bursts, Holland's start-up offset, fuel-exhaustion log-on | `both_startup-offset` × fuel-exhaustion |
| 5 | **00:19 Holland H2** | both bursts at face value (R600 BTO + R600 BFO + R1200 BFO, no R1200 BTO), log-on not from fuel exhaustion | `both_no-offset` × other |

1. **Pete's conditional option.** "R600 BTO + Raw BFO, then R1200 Raw BFO (no BTO)" is the same data
   treatment as Holland H2, as end of flight has mapped it. So it is not a separate option, **unless** Holland
   added a bias term or otherwise adjusted the raw observations in H2.
   - **End of flight:** confirm this against Holland arXiv:1702.02432, citing the page. Post the answer.
   - If Holland did adjust them, add option 6, **"00:19 R600 BTO + Raw BFO + R1200 Raw BFO"**, to the core set.
2. **Log-on cause.**
   - Options 1-3 use the log-on cause with no lag term (`other`).
   - The fuel-exhaustion-lag versions of options 1-3 are **optional, on request**.
   - H1 and H2 carry their own causes, as defined above.
3. **Existence constraints.**
   - Every core option applies the facts that the aircraft was transmitting at 00:19:37 and did not answer at
     01:15:56 (end of flight's `+alive`). These are observations of the log-on events, not of the BTO/BFO
     values.
   - The unconstrained version is optional, on request.
4. **Optional, on request only (Pete):**
   - **"00:19 Inflated BFO Noise"** (all `inflated` arms);
   - **"00:19 Both BTOs"** (`both-bto`);
   - the R1200-only arms;
   - the fuel-exhaustion-lag variants of options 1-3;
   - unconstrained (not `+alive`).

   These are no longer reported by default.
5. **Holland H1 and H2 must become estimable. They are not to be reported as "not estimable" indefinitely.**
   - The diagnosis is already agreed: settling `results/settling-h1h2-estimability.md`, end of flight
     ~15:24, searched areas.
   - Both bursts need a ~0.6 g push-over between 00:19:29 and 00:19:37. End of flight's descent proposal
     produces one for 0.8 % of its weight (about 300 of 100,000 parents).
   - This is now **end of flight's top priority**. Its entry is below.
   - Until it lands, report options 4 and 5 as **"not yet estimable - targeted sampler in progress"**.

Results already published keep their old labels. Re-label at your next re-run.

## 2026-10-10 ~17:30 UTC - architecture → end of flight (cc all): Pete on Holland H1/H2. Investigate, do not force. Supersedes item 1 of my ~16:30 entry

Pete does **not** want the push-over forced into the simulation. He wants to know:
1. Whether the low share (about 0.8 % of proposal weight reaching Δv < −8,000 ft/min) is physical evidence or an
   artefact of how our descent model is set up.
2. How plausible such a trajectory is, given:
   - the aircraft's performance;
   - the trajectories that fit the data at 00:11;
   - what is known about the operating modes at the first and second flame-outs;
   - the kinematically feasible set under no control, and under human control.
3. How the R600-then-R1200 pair serves as evidence, compared with a large sample of the possibilities.
4. Other explanations: for example, the second burst coinciding with ocean impact or rapid deceleration,
   break-up, or attitude, antenna or oscillator effects.

**My correction.** I wrote that "the sampler has to aim at it". To be precise:
- An exactly weighted importance sampler leaves the prior, and the answer in expectation, unchanged. It only
  makes the estimate precise.
- **Whether our prior covers the feasible kinematics is a separate modelling question.** That question
  comes first.

**Now:**
- An independent read-only study (architecture sub-agent) is answering 1-4 from the existing (b) impacts, which
  carry the burst-state latents, together with your model code and the literature. Report:
  `results/burst-0019-plausibility-architecture.md`.
- **End of flight: do not build the targeted proposal yet.** Keep the two tanks, the impact-time shares and the
  option-name work going. Any change to the descent prior or proposal waits for the study and Pete.
- Pete is discussing the simulation's intent with you directly; the study does not pre-empt that.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-10 ~19:10 UTC - architecture → ALL MODULES: RULING (Pete) - language on charts and reports; and two answers

### A. Charts and reports (Pete). Applies to everything produced from now on.

1. **Titles, headings, axis labels and legends:** no project jargon and no cryptic abbreviations.
   - Describe what is unique to our work in **ASD-STE100** (Simplified Technical English). Examples: "Impact
     positions when the 00:19 R600 BTO is used", not "r600-bto+alive, core (b)".
   - **Use normally accepted statistical and scientific terms as they are:** posterior, log-likelihood, Bayes
     factor, split-half, standard deviation, 2σ, Monte Carlo noise, and so on. Do not paraphrase them.
   - Internal codes (arm names, stratum codes, commit ids) go only in the technical footnote or in code.
2. **Footnotes come in two short versions, one under the other:**
   - **(i) STE100:** what the chart shows, from which run, and the main assumptions, in plain words.
   - **(ii) Technical:** standard statistical and scientific language with the identifiers: run, build, seeds,
     particles, 00:19 option, log-on cause, ocean model, labels such as "not converged".
   - **Both together take no more than the bottom 25 % of the image.** Keep to the essentials.
3. The standard 00:19 option names still apply (ruling ~16:30 UTC).

### B. The facts after 00:19 in the core options (hydroacoustics' question, item 3)

My ruling intended **(b)**: aircraft transmitting at 00:19:37, **and** not powered at 01:15:56. These are the two
facts that were directly observed.
- **End of flight:** please expose (b) as its own variant.
- Until then, modules use **(a)** (`+alive`) and say so.
- **(c)** `+silent` adds the "no second APU log-on" factor under `other`. That absence is also an observation, but
  its likelihood depends on end of flight's model of when a further log-on would occur.
  - It removes 44-90 % of the `other` weight, so it is a strong, model-dependent term.
  - Show (c) **beside** (b) as a declared variant.
  - It becomes default only after end of flight documents that model and its sources, and Pete agrees.

### C. Should the 00:19 data re-weight the strata? (Pléiades' question, also hydroacoustics')

**Yes. That is Bayes' rule.** For each 00:19 option:

    P(family | all data, option) ∝ P0(family) × Z_core(family) × Ẑ_00:19(family, option)

where Ẑ_00:19 is end of flight's per-family evidence factor for that option. Holding core's P(family) fixed across
options would ignore part of the data. Under "00:19 Held Out" the factor is 1, so nothing changes there.
- **End of flight:** publish Ẑ_00:19 per family and per option, with its Monte Carlo error. Modules mix strata with
  these weights.
- **While core is unconverged:** show the fixed-weight mixture beside the re-weighted one, both labelled.
- Not for Holland H1 or H2 until they are estimable.

- Modular Architecture

## 2026-10-10 ~19:25 UTC - architecture → ALL MODULES: RULING (Pete) - "00:19 Both BTOs (Davey)" for selective use only

- **"00:19 R600 BTO Only" stays in the core set.**
  - It is Inmarsat's recommended treatment: the R600 Log-on Request with its fixed 4,600 µs offset, found from
    the terminal's own history (Ashton et al. 2015, §3.3, p. 7, and p. 16).
  - Inmarsat says the later log-on-sequence BTOs "should be ignored" (p. 7).
- **"00:19 Both BTOs (Davey)"** is the R600 BTO (σ 63 µs) plus the anomalous R1200 BTO (σ 43 µs), corrected by
  −4 × 7,820 µs, with no BFOs. That is Davey et al. 2016, Table 10.1, p. 88. Use it **only** for:
  - comparisons with Davey;
  - the reproduction section.

  Elsewhere it is optional, on request.
- **When it is shown, the technical footnote states:**
  - the 7,820 µs correction is empirical, from logs not published (Davey pp. 26-27), and its origin is not
    fully determined;
  - 7,812.5 µs would shift the corrected value by 30 µs (about 0.7σ);
  - under these σ values the R1200 BTO carries more weight than the R600 BTO;
  - the two residuals have opposite signs (Davey p. 93).
- Internal arm: `both-bto` (footnote only).

## 2026-10-10 ~19:45 UTC - ocean transport → ocean settling, Pléiades (cc architecture): wider GLORYS12 profile column; transport-error correlation for nearby objects (merged `2f23c39`)

**Settling: wider profile column, as asked at ~16:00 UTC.**
- **Path:** `/Users/pete/Downloads/mh370-ocean-data/glorys12/profile/grid_75-115E_45-10S/glorys12v1_uo_vo_thetao_so_75-115E_45-10S_20140307-20140314.profile.json`
- **Content:** the same product, variables, 50 levels, dates (daily means 7–14 March 2014, at label + 12 h, still
  provisional) and manifest format as the 80–112 E, 45–18 S column, over 75–115 E, 45–10 S.
- **Check:** in the overlap, the data and `deptho` are **bit-identical** to the existing column, so in-window
  results do not change. `GridProfile` gives the same answer at 92 E, 35 S: 45 levels, model floor 3,796.5 m.
  It now also answers north of 18 S. At 100 E, 14 S: 49 levels, floor 5,902.5 m. At 105.5 E, 11.2 S: 47 levels,
  floor 4,631 m.
- **Size:** 1.30 GB. sha256 values are in `results/ocean-data-manifest.md`.

**Pléiades: transport-error correlation between nearby objects (request of 9 October, ~22:40 UTC).**
- **Note:** `results/ocean-transport-error-pairs.md`, with the table in the JSON beside it.
- **Data:** undrogued GDP pairs from the replay residuals, using GLORYS12 + 1% ERA5 and GlobCurrent + 1% ERA5,
  at leads 13 and 15 days and cross-lag. Intervals are drifter-block bootstraps.
- **The set you specified (same start, search box, March–May) has only 7 pairs from 4 drifters**, too few for an
  estimate. The note therefore reports two wider sets: same start over the whole domain (184 pairs) and starts
  within 2 days (884 pairs).
- **At your 40–80 km separations:** point estimates are 0.07–0.41 for GLORYS12 and −0.16–0.31 for GlobCurrent.
  The bootstrap upper limits are 0.24–0.72. **ρ = 0.5 sits inside the measured range as an upper sensitivity;
  ρ = 0.8 is above every 25–100 km upper limit.** A central value of about 0.2–0.3 describes the measurements.
  This is a finding; the choice is yours.
- **0–25 km:** values are higher, 0.4–0.8, and dominated by drifters deployed together.

**Disk (for the architect).** The data volume has **52 GiB free (94% used)**, below the 100 GiB floor. Today's
ocean-transport additions are about 2 GB: this column and the pair file. Most of the space is used elsewhere.
Nothing of mine is pending download.

- **Machine:** 2 threads at most, no heavy lock.
- **Charts:** none. The note follows the language ruling: plain headings, statistical terms as they are.

— ocean transport (architecture sub-agent)


## 2026-10-10 13:53 -0600 — Architecture → all modules: standing rule on side questions

Pete, 10 Oct 2026: when he asks a side question, answer it and then go back at once to the work you were doing. If that work is complete, start the next item in your backlog. Do not end your turn after a side answer while you have work in progress or a backlog. End your turn only when the backlog is empty or every item is blocked on something you cannot do yourself. Before you end it, write here which items are blocked and on what. An approved run whose gates you can execute is not blocked: start it.

This rule is also in your profile, from your next turn.

## 2026-10-10 14:05 -0600 — architecture → ocean settling: stand-in running now (do not duplicate)

Your backlog item "widen my ocean window once ocean transport supplies the wider profile" is unblocked and idle, so an architecture stand-in is running it now on core (b), with your recipe and ocean transport's wider GLORYS12 column. Output: results/settling-next-run-b-wider-profile-standin.md and a '-wider' wreckage-sample file (the previous one is not overwritten). Please review it when it lands. H1/H2 maps still wait on end of flight.

## 2026-10-10 ~20:15 UTC - end of flight: the three diagnostic smokes are in (SMOKE, one seed, core (b) unconverged)

Note: `results/eof-diagnostic-smokes-oct10/README.md`. No default changed. Option names follow the core set, with `+alive`.

1. **Trim referenced to the state at loss** (new switch `envelope.trim_reference_at_loss`, default off and byte-identical).
   - The prior push-over tail P(Δv ≤ −10,450 ft/min) falls **0.274 % → 0.222 % (−19 %)**.
   - 00:19 Holland H2 effective parents 8.3 → 3.0, and H1 13.2 → 3.4. These counts are too small to read further.
   - Every other option is unchanged.
   - Ruling item 3 is ready for the next re-sweep.
2. **Within-parent saturation: within-parent sampling IS the binding limit.**
   - With 1,024 descents on the 32-descent top parents, their ln Z *falls* (H2 −1.29, H1 −2.05; the winner's curse).
   - A random 2,000 of the other parents at 1,024 descents shows that **~83 % of the H1/H2 evidence lies in parents that score nothing at
     32 descents**.
   - Even at 1,024 descents, only ~10 (H2) / ~2 (H1) of 2,000 random parents carry it.
   - The total ln Z agrees between 32 and 1,024 descents (H2 −23.97 against −23.55; H1 −31.25 against −31.52). The posterior is what cannot
     be estimated.
   - **Implication:** brute force needs at least 100 M descents per seed. The efficient route is an exact within-parent sampler on the
     burst-time regime (study B2/B3) after core request 9.
   - **That is a sampling change for Pete to approve; not built.**
3. **Boeing 8-s window occupancy.** The estimator reproduces the study's Table 6 exactly (Boeing H2 0.12 %, H1 1.61 %).
   - **Point mass (current base): 0 H2 windows in all 114 fixture traces.** H1 windows appear only in the divergent spiral (3.4 %).
   - **6-DOF fit (unconverged): 0 H2 windows in all ten cases** (Boeing 6). It misses the dives in cases 4, 5 and 10, and damps the glide
     phugoids (peak g 0.05 against 0.31-0.34). **The ruling item 1 gate is not passed.** The case-by-case table is in the note. Next: diagnose
     the shared-stage stall; the refit under the heavy lock will be announced first.

**For Settling, Searched Areas, Hydroacoustics and Pléiades:**
- 00:19 Holland H1 / H2 stay **"not yet estimable - targeted sampler in progress"**.
- The cause is now measured: within-parent sampling, not the hand-off.
- Nothing you hold changes.

**Next, in order:**
- the impact-time-shares files for next-run (running), with the late-tail attribution;
- the `unpowered` constraint variant (b) and the 00:19 evidence factor per stratum;
- then the two tanks.

- End of flight

## 2026-10-10 ~20:40 UTC - end of flight: impact-time shares on next-run (with `unpowered`), late-tail attribution, and the 00:19 evidence factor per family

Both products are on the exchange, under `end-of-flight/next-run/summary/`. Notes are in `results/eof-impact-time-next-run-oct10/` and
`results/eof-family-evidence-oct10/`.

Labels: core (b) split-half NOT converged; two-tank bookkeeping only; idle floor ON; dive class (b) PROVISIONAL.

1. **Impact-time shares** (`summary/impact-time/<stratum>-impact-time-shares.json`, `<stratum>-constraints.json`).
   - Same keys as reference-289, so **Hydroacoustics' gate can run**. The legacy `*_plain_alive_silent` keys are kept.
   - New variant **`unpowered`** = ruling B (b): airborne at 00:19:37 and not powered at 01:15:56. `silent` is shown beside it.
   - **00:19 Held Out, `other`:** 9.6-10.7 % of impacts fall before 00:19:37 and 0.06-0.30 % after 01:15:56. `unpowered` keeps 0.90, the same
     as `alive`; `silent` keeps 0.11.
2. **Late-tail attribution (for Hydroacoustics): the hand-offs, not the idle floor.**
   - The idle floor off/on on the same reference-289 hand-off gives 1.69 % against 1.72 %.
   - The (b) free-stratum seeds give **0.945 / 0.035 / 0.214 / 0.007 %**, carried by 4,913 / 243 / 1,394 / 62 parents. Reference-289 has
     1.6-2.2 % and 7,400-10,200 parents in every seed.
   - This is core (b)'s non-convergence. Treat the (b) late tail as not estimable seed to seed.
3. **00:19 evidence factor per family** (`summary/family-evidence-next-run-b.json`), with the seed-s.e. stated.
   - **00:19 R600 BTO Only:** the families agree within 0.2 nat. The re-weighted mixture median is −37.94, against −37.93 at fixed weights.
   - **00:19 R600 BTO + Raw BFO:** descent-climb is +0.48 ± 0.21 nat against free. Its weight goes 0.138 → 0.204, and the median moves
     −37.42 → −37.46.
   - **00:19 Held Out:** factor 1 (P(alive) = 0.90 everywhere).
   - **H1/H2 are not re-weighted** (not yet estimable).
   - **For Pléiades, Hydroacoustics, Searched Areas and Settling:** mix by `p_family_reweighted` per option, and show the fixed-weight mixture
     beside it (ruling C).

**Core request 11 (new, in `hypothesis.toml`), for core:**
- (a) `FlightState` gains `fuel_left_kg`, `fuel_right_kg` and `first_flameout_unix_s`;
- (b) `FuelFlow` gains `fuel_flow_inop_kg_h_at` (live-engine flow from `grid_inop` × `inop_flow_scale`).

Without these, my module cannot know at takeover that the right engine is already out. Meanwhile, with core's s6/s7/s8 in the chain, **the
core flies the one-engine phase up to the takeover**, and I continue right-dry rows twin-engine on the left pool (disclosed stub).

**For the fuel session:** internal-v1.1 is not reachable from this workspace, and it cannot be rebuilt here: the MH371 ACARS workbook is
absent. Please place it on the exchange (e.g. `mh370-exchange/fuel-model/internal-v1.1.json`). Until then I use **v1 + `inop_flow_scale =
0.5`**, which your ~07:00 entry states is exactly equivalent. I will never combine v1.1 with 0.5.

## 2026-10-10 ~20:45 UTC - end of flight: run C compact impact format, column list and size, for consumers to check BEFORE I write

Architecture ~14:30 -0600 (Pete): compact is required.
- **Writing:** each seed is written full in my workspace, converted, verified, and only the compact file goes to the exchange. The full file is
  then removed from my own workspace. Peak extra disk is about 2.7 GB, one seed at a time.
- **Layout:** `end-of-flight/next-run-c/<stratum>/seed-<k>/{impacts32.npy, parents32.npy, run.json, COLUMNS.txt, SHA256SUMS}`, plus a README.

**Encoding.**
- **float32 throughout.**
- **Times are seconds after 2014-03-08 00:00:00 UTC** (`T0 = 1394236800`), because float32 cannot hold unix time: 1.39e9 s would be resolved
  only to 128 s. At these offsets the resolution is ≤ 1 ms.
- **Integers are exact** (parent < 2^24).
- **`weight` is the impact-row prior weight with the within-parent correction already applied**, as today. `log_q_correction` is therefore
  dropped.

**Parent-level fields go to `parents32.npy`** (one row per hand-off parent: `parent`, hand-off `weight`, `mode`, `alternative`). They are not
repeated per descent.

**`impacts32.npy`: 53 core columns.**
1. `parent`, `family`, `weight`;
2. `t_impact_s`, `t_takeover_s`, `t_realised_flameout_s`, `t_onset_s`;
3. `latitude_deg`, `longitude_deg`, `arc_distance_nm`;
4. `velocity_east_mps`, `velocity_north_mps`, `velocity_up_mps`, `flight_path_angle_deg`, `mass_kg`. Kinetic energy is dropped: it is
   ½ m |v|² from these, and the vertical part is ½ m v_up²;
5. `takeover_latitude_deg`, `takeover_longitude_deg`, `takeover_altitude_ft`;
6. `bto_residual_us:m0019a`, `bto_residual_us:m0019b`, `bfo_innovation_hz:m0019a`, `bfo_innovation_hz:m0019b`. The BTO-only options are
   derived from these;
7. `loglik:r600/no-offset`, `loglik:both/no-offset`, `loglik:both/startup-offset` (the core set). `loglik:none` is identically 0, so it is
   dropped;
8. `latent:onset_mechanism`, `latent:control_realised`, `latent:profile_shape`, `latent:engines_thrusting_at_onset`,
   `latent:spiral_divergent`, `latent:free_dynamics_started_s`, `latent:max_descent_rate_fpm`, `latent:time_descending_s`, `latent:timed_out`;
9. `latent:last_burst_latitude_deg`, `latent:last_burst_longitude_deg` (Pléiades §11);
10. `latent:state_m0019a_altitude_ft`, `latent:state_m0019a_vertical_speed_fpm`, `latent:state_m0019b_altitude_ft`,
    `latent:state_m0019b_vertical_speed_fpm` (the H1/H2 diagnostics);
11. `latent:impact_heading_deg`, `latent:impact_bank_deg`, `latent:impact_energy_transferred_j`, `latent:energy_transfer_t05_s`,
    `latent:energy_transfer_t95_s`, `latent:energy_transfer_tau90_s`, `latent:energy_transfer_peak_rate_w`, `latent:energy_transfer_n_pulses`,
    `latent:impact_tau_method`;
12. `latent:breakup_p_intact`, `latent:breakup_p_broken`, `latent:breakup_p_fragmented`, `latent:debris_class`.

**Optional: 6 more columns, the on-request 00:19 arms.**
- `loglik:r600/inflated`, `loglik:r600/startup-offset`, `loglik:r1200/inflated`, `loglik:r1200/no-offset`, `loglik:r1200/startup-offset`,
  `loglik:both/inflated`.
- **Recommended: keep them.** They cannot be recomputed without re-running, and they cost about 0.1 GB per stratum-seed set.

**Dropped (45 columns; the exact list is in `COLUMNS.txt` and in the README).**
- The fuel and onset bookkeeping latents (`fuel_*`, `mechanism_*`, `onset_prediction_*`, `powered_after_core_exhaustion_s`, the `*_assumed`
  flags).
- The aero draws (`ld_max_clean`, `windmilling_per_engine`, `rat_increment`).
- `weather_clamped`, `max_mach`, `max_altitude_ft`, `time_extrapolated_s`, `surface_pressure_altitude_ft`, `spiral_doubling_s`,
  `control_requested`, `recovery_*`, `family_prior`, `impact_vertical_speed_mps` (it duplicates `velocity_up_mps`), kinetic energy (both columns), `log_q_correction` and `loglik:none`.
- The takeover ground velocity.
- `state_m2315_*` and `state_m0011_*` (NaN, or the takeover state, at a 00:11 hand-off).
- The m0019a/m0019b burst latitude and longitude: m0019b equals `last_burst_*`, and m0019a is within metres of it.

**I report these per seed in `run.json` as summary statistics** (counts, shares and quantiles), so nothing silent is lost.

**Size**, assuming run C = 4 strata × 8 seeds × 100,000 parents × 32 descents:

| set | per seed | total |
|---|---|---|
| 53 core columns | 0.68 GB | 21.7 GB |
| with the 6 optional columns (59) | 0.76 GB | **24.2 GB** |
| old format, for comparison | 2.7 GB | about 87 GB |

At N = 4 children (16 descents) these sizes halve; that is the lever if 24.2 GB is too much. The 5 GB disk floor holds either way: the volume has about 83 GiB free.

**Tested** on `next-run/next-free/seed-1` (3.2 M rows):
- Conversion takes 21 s and gives 0.755 GB with the optional columns.
- The worst time error is 0.24 ms; the worst relative error elsewhere is 6e-8.
- `loglik:none` is proved identically 0 at write time, and the reader restores it.
- **`option_posteriors` gives the same answer on the compact file as on the full one:** across all 96 option × cause × constraint
  combinations, median latitude, ESS and mean displacement agree to ≤ 5e-6 (relative).
- `displacement_hist.option_posteriors` now reads either format, so code that imports it (Searched Areas, Hydroacoustics) needs no change.

**Consumers (Settling, Searched Areas, Pléiades, Hydroacoustics):** please flag any column you read that is dropped above. I will also ship a
reader, `smoke/compact_impacts.py`, which returns the same names as today; the time columns come back as unix seconds.

## 2026-10-10 15:20 -0600 — architecture → ALL MODULES: RULING (Pete) - next milestone: end-to-end pass, in general and under the Pléiades hypothesis

Pete's intent is forward prediction: 18:01 prior → trajectories across the kinematically feasible space, selected against the evidence → impact trajectories, locations and nature under his two hypothesis families → settling, drift, hydroacoustics, Pléiades → updated impact PDF, seabed PDF and searched areas. Twice: in general, and under the Pléiades hypothesis.

Hypothesis families (end of flight labels every impact; requested a4d4427a): **A1** cruise to fuel exhaustion then uncontrolled descent; **A2** cruise to fuel exhaustion then controlled / arrested descent; **B** deliberate planned descent before fuel exhaustion. Results per family first; any average only beside a prior sensitivity.

Stages:
1. **Pass 0 (now, core (b)): pipeline test.** Architecture stand-in wires engine/crates/compose to real module outputs (results/composer-pass0-next-run-b.md). Its main deliverable is the interface-gap table; modules with a gap will get an entry. Numbers are PIPELINE TEST only. Beside it: the Pléiades-conditional analysis for 00:19 R600 BTO + Raw BFO (stand-in, Pete's request).
2. **Run C** (deskstar, ETA ~23:50 UTC) → end of flight's compact sweep with family labels → settling, drift, hydroacoustics, Pléiades, searched areas re-run on run C (stand-ins if a thread is idle).
3. **Pass 1 (overnight, run C):** composed, general and under H, per family. First pass to read if run C passes split-half. Labels: EoF physics provisional; GlobCurrent F1 until its re-run; hydroacoustics low-power until raw IMS data.
4. **Pass 2 (paper):** after EoF's new physics passes the Boeing calibration, drift's product-relative GlobCurrent re-run and node extension B, and (if obtained) raw H01W/H08S.

Each module: keep your outputs in the shared per-impact format (same rows as end of flight's impacts.npy, declared observation IDs), so the composer can read them without adapters. Post READY files on the exchange as now.

## 2026-10-10 ~21:20 UTC - end of flight → architecture (cc composer, all consumers): hypothesis-family labels (A1/A2/B), final run C column list, and what the physics cannot yet produce

Answers architecture 14:55 -0600 (`a4d4427a`). The labels are **derived columns** in the compact file, computed at write time from columns the
module already emits (`smoke/compact_impacts.py: family_labels`). No re-simulation is needed, and the full-format runs can be labelled the
same way.

**Mapping of my branches onto Pete's families:**

| code | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `onset_code` | 0 | at fuel exhaustion (flame-out-associated onset, including rows already dry at takeover) |
| `onset_code` | 1 | before fuel exhaustion (anticipatory, or a response to the fuel cue) |
| `control_code` (realised) | 0 | uncontrolled (no intervention) |
| `control_code` | 1 | controlled, then lost (maintained-then-lost; includes an undemonstrated recovery, which the module already reports so) |
| `control_code` | 2 | controlled or arrested to the surface (ditching attempt, or an upset with a dynamically demonstrated recovery) |
| `family_code` | 1 | **A1**: onset at exhaustion, uncontrolled |
| `family_code` | 2 | **A2**: onset at exhaustion, controlled or arrested |
| `family_code` | 3 | **B**: onset before exhaustion, any control |
| `family_code` | 4 | **A, controlled then lost**: the A1/A2 boundary, kept separate |

- **For code 4, PROVISIONAL:** compose it **with A1** (its impact is uncontrolled), with "with A2" as the sensitivity. This needs Pete to rule.
- `latent:onset_mechanism`, `latent:control_realised`, `latent:profile_shape` and `latent:recovery_demonstrated` are kept, so finer splits stay
  possible.

**Shares** on core (b) next-run (seed means; A1 / A2 / A-then-lost / B):

| stratum | prior | 00:19 Held Out +alive | 00:19 R600 BTO Only +alive | 00:19 R600 BTO + Raw BFO +alive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| free | 0.113 / 0.187 / 0.152 / 0.549 | 0.112 / 0.208 / 0.157 / 0.523 | 0.112 / 0.232 / 0.188 / 0.468 | 0.074 / 0.124 / 0.116 / 0.686 |
| Davey dynamics + radar | 0.112 / 0.187 / 0.149 / 0.551 | 0.112 / 0.209 / 0.155 / 0.524 | 0.112 / 0.234 / 0.188 / 0.466 | 0.096 / 0.156 / 0.138 / 0.610 |
| descent-climb | 0.113 / 0.185 / 0.153 / 0.549 | 0.115 / 0.204 / 0.161 / 0.520 | 0.120 / 0.233 / 0.195 / 0.453 | 0.102 / 0.183 / 0.173 / 0.542 |
| routes | 0.116 / 0.190 / 0.157 / 0.537 | 0.115 / 0.213 / 0.163 / 0.510 | 0.108 / 0.241 / 0.199 / 0.452 | 0.087 / 0.183 / 0.165 / 0.564 |

**These shares are the module's prior (about 56 % B), barely updated.** The data after 00:11 hardly separate the families. **Per-family results
must therefore be read as conditional, not as evidence for a family.**

**What the current physics cannot yet produce (findings):**
1. **B only partly.**
   - In run C, B covers deliberate descents that start **after 00:11** and before the predicted exhaustion.
   - The 00:11 hand-off has already conditioned on cruise to 00:11. A deliberate descent that began earlier (22:41-00:11) exists only:
     - in my 22:41 arms (V2, V2u), which are not part of run C;
     - in core's descent-climb stratum, as a core family.
   - The fuel-cue onsets are counted as B: a deliberate response before exhaustion.
2. **A2 only as commanded profiles.**
   - These are a ditching approach, a best glide, and a demonstrated recovery, flown by the point mass with commanded rates ≤ 6,500 ft/min.
   - **There is no deliberate push-over yet** (ruling item 4, after the Boeing system sequence).
   - **No Boeing case calibrates A2**: Boeing flew no inputs.
3. **A1 is not yet Boeing-calibrated.**
   - Free dynamics are the fixed-C_L point mass with dive class (b), PROVISIONAL. It cannot unload: smoke 3 found no H2 window in 114 traces.
   - The 6-DOF gate is not passed; the refit is queued.
4. **One-engine phase:** core flies it to the takeover. After that, a right-dry row continues twin-engine on the left pool (stub, core request
   11).

**Final run C compact column list:**
- 54 core columns: the 53 posted at ~20:45, plus `latent:recovery_demonstrated`;
- 6 optional columns, kept as Pléiades asked;
- 3 derived columns (`onset_code`, `control_code`, `family_code`).

That is 63 float32 columns, or **0.81 GB per seed and about 25.8 GB for 4 strata × 8 seeds × 100,000 parents × 32 descents.** Checked
end-to-end on next-free seed 1.

**Run C recipe:** as eof-289-full / the stand-in sweep, plus:
- **trim at loss of control referenced to the state at loss** (ruling ~18:45, item 3, adopted: `smoke/trim-at-loss.toml`);
- core's run C chain re-applied in core's order, including the INOP-flow correction (my ~20:55 entry; core, please confirm the chain).

**Pléiades' `mh370 evaluate` gap:** I support their core request that `impact_columns_for` accepts the compact layout. The reader mapping is in
`compact_impacts.load` (times + T0, `mode`/`alternative` from parents32, KE from velocity and mass, `log_q_correction` = 0 because `weight`
carries it).

- End of flight

## 2026-10-10 ~21:30 UTC - end of flight → hydroacoustics (cc Pléiades, settling): kinetic energies come back under their old names

`compact_impacts.load` now returns `kinetic_energy_j` and `vertical_kinetic_energy_j`, rebuilt as ½ m |v|² and ½ m v_up² from `mass_kg`
(the impact mass, as the runner uses) and the impact velocities.
- Checked against the full file on next-run/next-free seed 1: the NaN pattern is identical, and the maximum relative difference is
  **1.6e-7** (float32 rounding).
- `loglik:none` is also restored (it is identically 0, and that is checked at write).
- Thank you for the gate result.

- End of flight

## 2026-10-10 ~21:50 UTC - ocean settling: seabed wreckage PDF for the core 00:19 option set on core (b), to the new rulings

`results/settling-core-set-next-run-b/`. It shows the five core options under their plain names, uses `unpowered` (airborne at 00:19:37, not powered at 01:15:56), and mixes strata re-weighted by end of flight's 00:19 evidence per family, with the fixed-weight mixture beside it. It follows the chart-language ruling and has two footnotes. Settling ran on the widened ocean window (75-115 E, 45-10 S; `hypothesis/settling` 5b595bf).

| option (re-weighted) | 90 % area: impacts → seabed (thousand km²) |
|---|---|
| 00:19 Held Out | 578.7 → 579.4 |
| 00:19 R600 BTO Only | 363.8 → 364.9 |
| 00:19 R600 BTO + Raw BFO | 238.8 → 239.4 (fixed weights: 242.3) |
| 00:19 Holland H1, H2 | not yet estimable (ESS 86, 124) |

- Settling adds 0.12-0.28 % at 90 % and at most 0.68 % at 99 %.
- The areas are unconverged: seed halves differ by 6-16 %, and Held Out spans 329-657 thousand km² across strata. This comes from core (b).
- This supersedes the stand-in's four-option result for core (b).
- **Correction:** settling's old renderer left 0.02-0.04 % of impact mass outside its fixed 80-112 E, 46-20 S grid. The new one sizes the grid to the impacts and asserts that no mass is lost.
- **Run C:** the prep reads end of flight's compact format through `compact_impacts.load`. Every column settling needs is kept or derived; kinetic energy from mass and velocity is exact on next-free seed 1. Nothing to flag on the ~20:45 column list.

## 2026-10-10 15:45 -0600 — architecture → ALL MODULES: RULING (Pete) - sampling coverage of the feasible kinematic space

The aim is to sample the whole kinematically feasible space of the 777-200ER, within its performance and limits, and let the evidence select. Under-sampling silently conditions the result on an assumption nobody made. Earlier studies may have done this, for example by sampling mainly cruise at altitude to fuel exhaustion followed by an uncontrolled descent.
1. Keep three sets apart and state each one: (a) the **feasible set**: what the aircraft can physically do, with sources; (b) the **model's reach**: what your physics and parameter ranges can produce at all; (c) the **proposal's coverage**: where your samples actually land, with ESS per region.
2. Any part of (a) that (b) cannot produce, or that (c) does not reach with adequate ESS, is a **gap**. Close it, or declare it as an explicit conditional hypothesis and name it in the label of every result it affects. A silent gap is a defect.
3. You may concentrate samples for precision (importance sampling, aimed proposals, tempering, strata). The prior must still cover the feasible set, and the weights must carry the proposal correction. Sampling may follow a hypothesis; weight comes only from the evidence.
4. Do not limit the scenarios to those that fit one reading of the data. Example: sampling descents only for the R600 BFO and not the Holland-type or other rapid descents. Every standard 00:19 option and every hypothesis family (A1, A2, B) must be estimable from the same sample set. If one is not estimable (low ESS), report it as a coverage gap and propose the fix; do not drop it.
5. A parameter bound narrower than the feasible range is a gap unless it has a source. A model cap (for example on descent rate or on unloading) is a reach gap, not a sampling choice.
6. Every results note has a **COVERAGE** section: the three sets, the gaps and their status, ESS per option, family and declared region, and parameter bounds with sources. Every review checks coverage first.

This rule is in every module profile from your next turn, and in the master prompts. Architecture keeps the gap register in ARCHITECTURE.md (section "Coverage register").

## 2026-10-10 ~21:40 UTC - end of flight: posterior-predictive check of the two 00:19 BFOs on core (b) (for Pete's "which options are favoured, or indeterminate")

`results/eof-postpred-0019-oct10/README.md`. Each BFO is checked against the trajectories selected **without** it, using the Bayesian p-value
of density type. Labels: core (b) unconverged; the point mass cannot unload.

1. **R600 BFO (182 Hz), given the data to 00:11 and the R600 BTO.**
   - p = **0.010-0.030** with no offset (σ 7 Hz); 0.10-0.18 with inflated noise (σ 34 Hz); 0.008-0.020 under Holland's start-up offset.
   - It needs a descent of about 4,500 ft/min at 00:19:29. **That is tension, not an anomaly.**
2. **R1200 BFO (−2 Hz), given the data to 00:11 and the R600 BTO and BFO.**
   - p = **0.4-7.6 × 10⁻⁴ under every BFO model.** It needs the ~0.6 g push-over.
   - Our feasible space is known to under-produce that manoeuvre (smokes 1-3, architecture study). So today this measures our model's space,
     not the aircraft's.
   - It is re-measured when the 6-DOF dynamics pass the gate.
3. **The results agree across all four core families and 16 seeds**, so they are not limited by core convergence.

**How this fits with the Bayes factors:** options that use different data are compared by this predictive check. The models of the same data
(H1 against H2, raw against inflated noise) are compared by Bayes factors, which are not estimable for H1/H2 yet.
