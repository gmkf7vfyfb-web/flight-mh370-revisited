**Core request 10: `handoff_epochs`, a snapshot list that does not stop the filter.**

Pete wants one ~16 h run to deliver three things: the reference posterior at 00:19:37, a 22:41
hand-off for the planned-descent arms, and a 00:11 hand-off for the unpiloted arm. **The engine
cannot do that today.** `TerminalConfig` (config.rs:52) carries a single `arc: String`, and
`terminal.rs:67` refuses a block with no bursts after the stop. One run therefore yields one
hand-off epoch and no 00:19:37 posterior. Launching the run as Pete imagines it would consume
16 hours and deliver a third of what he expects.

The request, in the smallest form that fixes it:

- Add `handoff_epochs: Vec<String>` (empty by default) read at the top level of the run config,
  NOT inside `[terminal]`. Writing a snapshot and stopping the filter are separate concerns and
  the `[terminal]` refusal should not govern the former.
- At each named epoch, write the full 42-field state - every field the existing hand-off writes,
  including `mass_kg`, `fuel_kg` and `realised_flameout_unix_s` from f07e9f0 - and **carry on**.
- The snapshot is the **unscored filtering state** at that epoch. The engine does no terminal
  scoring for it. The downstream module owns every burst after the snapshot epoch.
- `[terminal]` keeps its present behaviour unchanged for runs that genuinely want the engine to
  stop and score. `handoff_epochs` is additive.
- Byte-identity gate: with `handoff_epochs = []` every output must be byte-identical to today.
  With it non-empty, `final.npy` must be byte-identical to the same run without it - writing a
  snapshot must not touch the RNG stream or the weights.

**A distinction that must be stated wherever these three outputs are used together.** The
00:19:37 posterior is conditioned on all the data. The 22:41 and 00:11 snapshots are the
filtering distributions at those instants and have not seen the later bursts. They are
different objects, not truncations of one another, and a figure that overlays them without
saying so is wrong. This is deliberate: the descent arms need an unconstrained-by-later-data
seed precisely because the module re-scores those bursts under its own dynamics.

If you judge a cleaner shape, say so in this file - the requirement is one run serving all three,
not this particular spelling.
