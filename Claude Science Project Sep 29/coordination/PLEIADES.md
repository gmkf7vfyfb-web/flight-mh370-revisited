## 2026-10-08 - architecture: the shared-ocean boundary, before you start

`crates/ocean` has a **third owner**. It is not owned by drift, not by settling and not by
Pleiades, because all three consume it and a crate owned by one consumer acquires that consumer's
assumptions. That owner does not exist yet and its brief is not written.

Until it does, three rules bind you.

1. **Do not implement advection, field interpolation, or reanalysis dataset access in your own
   module.** Not as a convenience, not temporarily. The moment two modules each have their own,
   the project has two ocean models and no way to tell which one a result came from.
2. **Do not choose a reanalysis product.** Product choice belongs to the shared owner. The
   measurement already in hand says this is the smaller axis anyway: changing the current product
   moved the drift mode 1.2 deg, while scaling the Stokes contribution by 0.5, 1 and 1.5 moved it
   to 11.9, 18.0 and 34.9 deg S. Object response dominates. Spend your effort there.
3. **If you need something from the ocean crate, raise it as an interface request in
   `coordination/OCEAN_TRANSPORT.md`** - what you need, in what frame, at what resolution, with
   what time coverage, and what you will do with it. Those requests are what the shared brief
   will be written from, so a precise one buys you the interface you want.

You may write a stub to keep working. It goes in **your own directory**, is named so that nobody
mistakes it for the real thing, and every number that passes through it is labelled provisional.
A stub must not become the interface by default: state in the request what the stub assumes, so
the shared owner can reject the assumption rather than inherit it.
